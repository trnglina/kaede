*This review may contain minor spoilers.*

The thing with Noukin is that it doesn't have a serious bone in its body. Not a single one. No matter what serious topic comes up, it'll top it off with some comedic relief and leave you feeling either uncomfortably unsatisfied, or, if you quickly came to like the characters like I did, with mixed feelings of genuine relief.

{{< figure src="/images/posts/didnt-i-say-to-make-my-abilities-average-in-the-next-life-review/1.png" title="Noukin takes you on a comedic roller coaster of tension and quick relief" alt="A close-up of Mile, the show's purple-haired protagonist, looking relieved" >}}

Ultimately, whether this technique works for you depends on how willing you are to accept it. It's perfectly fair to view Noukin as having no consistent tone, and unwilling to tell a meaningful story, but I don't really think that's the point. If you're looking for a serious and dramatic story about family, death, and friendship, well, this isn't the show for you.

Noukin is a comedy through and through--and if you don't find the first couple of episodes funny, there's nothing more this show can offer you. If you do, however, it's an enjoyable ride. (If you're familiar with anime, you might recognise the director Oota Masahiko; this show is pretty similar to his other comedies.) The characters are likeable (if generally shallow and clichéd), its visuals are pretty (if not exactly beautiful), and it has most of the typical [isekai](/idams#isekai) trappings.

## Similar shows

[Kotoura-san](https://myanimelist.net/anime/15379/Kotoura-san) is another show that has serious topics on the surface, but in reality, offers little more than comedy. If you liked Kotoura-san, you might like Noukin, but if you disliked Kotoura-san, you'll almost certainly dislike Noukin as well.

[Gabriel DropOut](https://myanimelist.net/anime/33731/Gabriel_DropOut) is another show by the same director, and in my opinion, that particular director at his best. If you liked the comedy of Noukin, you might enjoy Gabriel DropOut as well. If Noukin struck you as unexceptional, you still might enjoy Gabriel DropOut's Japanese-school-life-fantasy-fusion setting, but just like with Noukin, there won't be much there other than comedy.

[Kono subarashii sekai ni shukufuku wo!](https://myanimelist.net/anime/30831/Kono_Subarashii_Sekai_ni_Shukufuku_wo) is pretty much the show for you if you like comedic [isekai](/idams#isekai) shows. Like with Noukin, you won't find any serious topics, but Konosuba boasts a similar setting with different comedic styles. If you didn't find Noukin particularly funny, but like the setting and premise, Konosuba may be worth a try.

*Didn’t I say to make my abilities average in the next life?! is known as {{Watashi, nouryoku wa heikinchi de tte itta yo ne!}} in Japanese, and is often shorted to {{Noukin}}.*
